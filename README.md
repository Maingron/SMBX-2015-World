This is my world I worked on back in 2015 for [Super Mario Bros X](https://supermariobrosx.org).

It works with version 1.3.0.1 of the game.

I made this public so you can get some inspirations and for archiving purposes.

## History
I was about 14 years old when I worked on this world and the levels aren't really great, but I thought I might still share the project files and maybe add some minor improvements 6 years later.

## Dependencies
This is a world for Super Mario Bros X, so you need 
- [Super Mario Bros X](https://supermariobrosx.org) 1.3.0.1
